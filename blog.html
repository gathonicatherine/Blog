            ASPECT OF MARRIAGE
        </h2>
        <div class="parag">
        <p>
            In the olden days, people from Tsonga really valued their traditions. 
            Women used to do all the chores and what the men used to do was only do
             the manly things rather than things. She didn’t refuse to do whatever 
             the women were doing but she used to do it, by overdoing it.Abel had 
             that dominant spirit in him where he refused Trevoh to go and see his 
             dad and for Patricia to attend church and all he thought of was how his 
             reputation would be like.
             we see an extraordinary woman with extraordinary principles that no one can change them or 
            can do anything about it. After going to Abel’s home, she saw how women used to be treated and 
            she was annoyed by that fact that and she never went back there again.Abel tried to rule over her 
            but she couldn’t bare with him and she left since no one ever said that a woman need to have a man to survive in this world.

            HOW HUMOUR IS POTRAYED IN BORN A CRIME
        </h3>
        <p>
            Humour is showcased when his mom is shot,which was one of the darkest moments in his life,humour helped his family heal. His<br>
             mother cracked a joke to stop Trevor from crying. She makes fun of how her nose looks and tells Trevor to look on <br>
            the bright side by saying" ...atleast now because of my nose , you are officially the best-looking person in the family".<br>
            Secondly, when he goes to school he surprises all students with his ability to speak multiple languages. And he got introduced to the<br>
            rest of the students who keep asking him to share his trick with them. This ability helped him a couple of times during scenerios.<br> 
            Also when there was a time whentwo guys wanted to steal from him and he actually shocked them with how he talks/his response back <br>
            since they though he was of the white race and couldn't understand their plans.Their reaction was crazy since they started laughing <br>
            and the way Trevoh planned or rather the response he gave was for them to go and steal some other place.<br>
            Thirdly, humour is potrayed when he preteded to be an American rapper, where he helped his friends get out of trouble, that really 
            showed how much he really valued his friends.<br>
